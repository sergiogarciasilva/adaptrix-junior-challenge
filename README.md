# Adaptrix Junior Developer Challenge

## Entity Extraction Pipeline Basics

**Time Limit:** 30 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Junior  
**AI Assistance:** Allowed (and encouraged!)

---

## Challenge Overview

Build a simplified entity extraction system that:
1. Reads a DOCX document containing a business operations report
2. Converts it to PDF format
3. Uses an LLM API to extract key entities (KPIs, dates, organizations)
4. Outputs structured JSON matching the provided template

---

## Deliverables

1. **`src/extract_entities.py`** - Your main extraction script
2. **`output/entities.json`** - Your extraction results
3. **Brief README update** - 3-5 sentences explaining your approach (add at bottom of this file)

---

## Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- An LLM API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, or similar)
- The extracted entities must include confidence scores

### Entity Types to Extract
1. **KPIs** - Business metrics with values and units (e.g., "OEE 78.5%", "Return Rate 24.96%")
2. **Dates** - Time references (e.g., "Week 45", "November 6-12")
3. **Organizations** - Company names and references

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Follow [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) to configure your environment
3. Review the input document: `input/gearhead_weekly_report.docx`
4. Review the output template: `output/entities.json.template`
5. Complete `src/extract_entities.py`
6. Run your solution and save output to `output/entities.json`

---

## Input Document

The input document (`input/gearhead_weekly_report.docx`) is a weekly operations summary from **Gearhead Cycles**, a bicycle manufacturing company.

Key content includes:
- Production metrics for Week 45, FY2023
- Critical KPIs: OEE, On-Time Delivery (OTD), Return Rate
- Target vs actual performance analysis

**Note:** Upload the `.doc` file using the helper module provided.

---

## Helper Modules

Two helper modules are provided in `src/helpers/`:

### `docx_helper.py`
Extracts text content from DOCX files.

```python
from helpers.docx_helper import extract_text_from_docx

text = extract_text_from_docx("input/gearhead_weekly_report.docx")
```

### `pdf_converter.py`
Converts DOCX to PDF (requires the document to be processed).

```python
from helpers.pdf_converter import convert_to_pdf

pdf_path = await convert_to_pdf("input/gearhead_weekly_report.docx")
```

---

## Output Format

Your output must match this structure (see `output/entities.json.template`):

```json
{
  "document": {
    "filename": "gearhead_weekly_report.docx",
    "extraction_timestamp": "2024-01-20T12:00:00Z"
  },
  "entities": {
    "kpis": [
      {
        "name": "OEE",
        "value": 78.5,
        "unit": "%",
        "context": "Overall Equipment Effectiveness",
        "confidence": 0.95
      }
    ],
    "dates": [...],
    "organizations": [...]
  },
  "statistics": {
    "total_entities": 12,
    "kpi_count": 4,
    "date_count": 3,
    "org_count": 2
  }
}
```

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Correct Entity Extraction | 30% | KPIs, dates, organizations extracted correctly |
| Code Quality | 25% | Clean, readable, follows Python conventions |
| Error Handling | 20% | Handles file errors, invalid data gracefully |
| Output Format Compliance | 15% | JSON matches template structure exactly |
| Bug Fixes | 10% | Identifies and fixes bugs in provided helper code |

---

## Architectural Improvements (Bonus)

Consider implementing:
- Error handling with try/except blocks
- Basic logging with timestamps
- Type hints on functions
- Docstrings for documentation
- Configuration externalization

---

## Submission

1. Ensure `output/entities.json` contains your results
2. Add a brief explanation of your approach at the bottom of this README
3. Push your changes to your fork or send as a zip file
